# Code behind the scanMiR paper

This is the code used to generate the data and figures of the scanMiR paper.

The code for the packages themselves are available in the respective repositories:

* [scanMiR](https://github.com/ETHZ-INS/scanMiR) (main package)
* [scanMiRData](https://github.com/ETHZ-INS/scanMiRData) (mouse/rat/human KdModels)
* [scanMiRApp](https://github.com/ETHZ-INS/scanMiRApp) (convenient wrappers, IndexedFst and shiny app)

The live scanMiR application can be accessed via: http://ethz-ins.org/scanMiR/

### Rough structure of the repo

The [Figures](Figures/) folder contains a subfolder (and markdowns) for each figure (and supplementaries), which in turn use the results of analyses contained in the other folders of the repo.
